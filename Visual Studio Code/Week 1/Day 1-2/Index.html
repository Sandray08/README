        <p>Amethyst has been highly esteemed throughout the ages for its stunning beauty and legendary powers to stimulate, and soothe, the mind and emotions. It is a semi-precious stone in today’s classifications, but to the ancients, it was a “Gem of Fire"; a Precious Stone worth, at times in history, as much as a Diamond.</p>
        <p>The name Amethyst is derived from the Greek word améthystos (αμέθυστος), meaning "not intoxicated", and comes from an ancient legend. The wine god Bacchus, angry over an insult and determined to avenge himself, decreed the first person he should meet would be devoured by his tigers.</p>
        <p>The unfortunate mortal happened to be a beautiful maiden named Amethyst on her way to worship at the shrine of Diana. As the ferocious beasts sprang, she sought the protection of the goddess and was saved by being turned into a clear, white crystal. Bacchus, regretting his cruelty, poured the juice of his grapes over the stone as an offering; giving the gem its lovely purple hue.</p>
